# CFG-Assignments
My first attempt to Git 

This is the second attempt to Git and this will be reflected once I push this to another branch that I have created.



# Hello World

## My name is Ana. I am  switching careers from social work to IT.

### *Welcome to my journey.*



 Below you can find my first attempts to push a local repository to a remote one using Git as VSC and my GitHub account. To begin, I created the files in the remote repository and used the SSH code to connect to my local repository in a folder named __Git__.

Then, I pulled the files from the _remote_ repository to my *local one*.

Next, I created a *new branch* in GitHub. This is where I will push my new developments to, so it doesn't affect the features of the code on main branch.

Now I can start modifying the README.md by adding more text and add new files in my local rep by using 
> **nano** *filename*
>
- *to create the file*
> **git add** *filename*
>
- *to add the file to staging area*
>  **commit -m** "*insert text to explain change*"
> 
- *to push files to local repository*

A good practice is to use
> git status
>
 This way we can check the status of our files.

**Next**, I moved files from the local **Staging Area** to the **Local repository**.

![commit with message.jpg](https://github.com/complete-rel/CFG-Assignments/blob/main/First%20Assignment/images/commit%20with%20message.jpg?raw=true)

I will create two new branches so other developers can use them for troubleshooting. 
Then I will push the updates and new branch to the remote repository.

Now my changes are reflected in the remote repository.![changes are reflecte in remote rep.jpg](https://github.com/complete-rel/CFG-Assignments/blob/main/First%20Assignment/images/changes%20are%20reflecte%20in%20remote%20rep.jpg?raw=true)

Finally, I created a pull request to merge the changes.
