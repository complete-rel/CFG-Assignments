# Question 1 - JS Assignment - web app demo on what was covered in the second week of the CFG  full stack degree.

This is my attempt to create a web app that takes input from the user and updates the web page based on the
input. The HTML and CSS should be simple but present. The primary focus is on JavaScript.


My java script code uses 
+ Use boolean values and if..else statements to branch logic of your program
+ Use a data structure like an array to store values
+ Use a loop or a while loop to reduce repetition
+ Use functions to make code reusable
+ Use console.log and alert to display messages
+ Use some HTML and CSS to create a basic website. Uses at least 4 different HTML tags
and I've styled at least 2 of them. 
+ Get input from the user on a web page
+ Make changes to the HTML or CSS using JavaScript
+ Use an event to trigger a change to a web page



This is a prototype of an traveling web app.
Enjoy selecting where you want to go to.
This will be continued in a full working traveling intinerary app.
